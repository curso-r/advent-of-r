# Suddenly, the experimental antenna control console lights up:
#
# Sleigh keys detected!
#
# According to the console, the keys are directly under the submarine. You
# landed right on them! Using a robotic arm on the submarine, you move the
# sleigh keys into the airlock.
#
# Now, you just need to get them to Santa in time to save Christmas! You check
# your clock - it is Christmas. There's no way you can get them back to the
# surface in time.
#
# Just as you start to lose hope, you notice a button on the sleigh keys: remote
# start. You can start the sleigh from the bottom of the ocean! You just need
# some way to boost the signal from the keys so it actually reaches the sleigh.
# Good thing the submarine has that experimental antenna! You'll definitely need
# 50 stars to boost it that far, though.
#
# The experimental antenna control console lights up again:
#
# Energy source detected.
# Integrating energy source from device "sleigh keys"...done.
# Installing device drivers...done.
# Recalibrating experimental antenna...done.
# Boost strength due to matching signal phase: 1 star
